# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

Predicting the bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

**Problem Statement:**

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

**Aim of project:**

The goal of the company Seoul Bike is providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes. It becomes a major concern to keep users satisfied. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count rents at each hour for a stable supply of rental bikes. We can suppose that this study could be reported to the company 'Seoul Bikes'. We think it could help them knowing if yes or not they have to supply bike stations in the city, in order to keep the customers.
